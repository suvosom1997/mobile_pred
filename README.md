# mobile price prediction

## Cloud Based Web Application

Hey ! Hope you are doing good. This is my first web application. It predicts whether the price of your mobile comes under the following categories based on your inputs:

<ul>
  <li>0 = regular, with a price range of Rs 5000 and Rs 8000</li>
  <li>1 = affordable, with a price range of Rs 8000 and Rs 12000</li>
  <li>2 = costly, with a price range of Rs 12000 and Rs 15000</li>
  <li>3 = Very costly, greater than Rs 15000</li>

This is a Machine Learning prediction based application that makes use of Python as the programming language, Flask as the application, Heroku as the cloud service platform and finally our good old HTML for the webpage. I understand you need to fill a lot of details, and a simple integer based output may seem a low return of your invested time, but I still urge you to judiciously provide the required details, so that you can understand the inbuilt simple but fascinating Artificial Intelligence that actually goes into it..

This web application is hosted in 'Heroku' cloud platform.
We need to have the following applications/platforms:
1. Visual Studio Code
2. Heroku
3. Git/ Github account
